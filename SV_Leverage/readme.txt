This MATLAB software implements the correlated particle hybrid sampler from the paper "Particle MCMC and correlated particle hybrid sampler for State Space Models".The folder "sv_leverage" gives the code to replicate the results for the univariate stochastic volatility model with leverage using a real dataset.1) The folder CPHS gives the code for the correlated particle hybrid sampler.2) The folder CPMMH gives the code for the correlated PMMH sampler.3) The folder HMC_STAN gives the R code for the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo implemented in R.4) The folder PGBS gives the code for the particle Gibbs with backward simulation.5) the folder PGDA gives the code for the particle Gibbs with data augmentation.6) the folder PHS gives the code for the particle hybrid sampler. 7) the folder "result_leverage_6000" gives the results for the simulated data with 6000 observations8) the folder "results_leverage" gives the results for the US stock return data with 3000 observations.9) the folder "stochvol" gives the results for the MCMC sampler implemented using stochvol package.
