This MATLAB software implements the correlated particle hybrid sampler from the paper "Particle MCMC and correlated particle hybrid sampler for State Space Models".The folder "Factor_GARCH" gives the code to replicate the results for the FACTOR GARCH MODEL using a real dataset.1) The folder CPHS gives the code for the correlated particle hybrid sampler.2) The folder PG gives the code for the particle Gibbs with backward simulation.3) the folder PHS gives the code for the particle hybrid sampler. 4) the folder "results" gives the results.
