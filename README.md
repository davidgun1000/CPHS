# CPHS

This MATLAB software implements the correlated particle hybrid sampler from the paper "Particle MCMC and correlated particle hybrid sampler for State Space Models".
There are two examples in the paper. They are univariate and multivariate stochastic volatility models.  
1) Folder "sv_leverage" gives the code to replicate the results for the univariate stochastic volatility model with leverage using a real dataset.
2) Folder "sv_covariate_leverage" gives the code to replicate the results for the univariate stochastic volatility model with leverage with covariate using a simulated dataset. 
3) Folder "Factor SV leverage" gives the code to replicate the results for the factor SV with leverage using a real dataset.
4) Folder "Factor GARCH diffusion model" gives the code to replicate the results for the factor GARCH diffusion model using a real dataset.  
Each folder has a folder ("results") containing all the results for that example.
