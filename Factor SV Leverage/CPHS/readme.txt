This MATLAB software implements the correlated particle hybrid sampler from the paper "Particle MCMC and correlated particle hybrid sampler for State Space Models".The folder gives the code for implementing CPHS for the Factor SV with leverage model.The main code is CPHS_SV_factor_real_leverage_onefactor.m for one factor factor SV modeland CPHS_SV_factor_real_leverage_fourfactor.m for four factors factor SV model.
