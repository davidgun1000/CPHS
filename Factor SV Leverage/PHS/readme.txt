This MATLAB software implements the correlated particle hybrid sampler from the paper "Particle MCMC and correlated particle hybrid sampler for State Space Models".The folder gives the code for implementing PHS for the Factor SV with leverage model.The main code is PHS_factor_SV_leverage_onefactor.m for one factor factor SV modeland PHS_factor_SV_leverage_fourfactor.m for four factors factor SV model.
